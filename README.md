# Embedded_FSM_w_Simulation
This project demonstrates a modular and event-driven Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture suitable for embedded systems. It includes:

🧠 A clean, pointer-based FSM implementation in Embedded C with entry/exit logic

🖥️ A real-time graphical simulation using Python + Tkinter, visualizing state transitions and events

📊 UML-like node diagram for better visualization and explanation

🔄 Designed for easier debugging, testing, and system flow control in RTOS-free embedded applications.
